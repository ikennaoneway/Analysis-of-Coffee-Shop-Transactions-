## Data Cleaning/Transformation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task: 
1.	Added a column for Revenue using the operator 	=D2*H2
2.	Added a column for month using 			=MONTH(B2)
3.	Added a column for monthName using 		=TEXT(B2,"mmm")
4.	Added a column for weekday using 			=WEEKDAY(B2,2)
5.	Added a column for weekdasyName using 		=TEXT(B2,"ddd") 
6.	Added a column for Hour using 			=HOUR(C2)
